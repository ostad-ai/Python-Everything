# Python-Everything

1) Lists: Introduction.
2) Lists: Example, computing Khayyam-Pascal's triangle.
3) Lists: Copying.
4) Exercise: Solving quadratic equation.
5) Stacks are implemented by lists. An example to reverse a list with stack is also included.
6) strings in Python: Introduction.
7) Emojis in Python with some examples.
8) Working with polynomials represented by lists in Python. Here, we implement, from scratch, addition and multiplication of two polynomials.
9) Removing punctuations from a given text. Here, we also download a text-file from the Internet using *request* of *urllib*.
10) Dictionaries in Python: Introduction, from creating to accessing, updating, deleting items, and copying.
11) Exercise: Converting variable names to strings, and vice versa, using function *globals()*.
12) Frequency counting of words (or letters) of a given text. Also, a real text is downloaded from the Internet and the functions are tested with it. We use the *get* function of dictionaries in Python. Moreover, we plot the frequencies with  *bar* of *matplotlib*.
13) Sets in Python: Introduction, which includes set creation and initialization, acessing elements, set operations, copying and clearing, and also a hint on *frozensets*. Moreover, an example is given about *Jaccard distance*.
14) Pickle module, introduction: We use *dump* and *load* to save Python object into a byte stream and vice versa.
